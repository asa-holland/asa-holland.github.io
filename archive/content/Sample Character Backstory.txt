I am a 15 year old Human Cleric.

Appearance:
I am 5'8" tall, and weigh 206 lbs.

Family and Early Life:
 I was born on 28 Nightal (the Drawing Down) in a home and raised by my father and my stepmother. I grew up with a comfortable lifestyle living in a large house near Zelbross. My mother was struck down by an angry god when I was three years old. I had seven siblings and a few close friends. I lived an ordinary childhood.

Background and Personality:
I am a Chaotic Good Sailor. I follow Deep Sashelas (Chaotic Good), the elf god of the sea. My ideals tend to pull my alignment towards Chaotic. A supernatural being in service to the gods called me to become a divine agent in the world. I never pass up a friendly wager. I believe that the sea is freedom: the freedom to go anywhere and do anything. One of my relatives was a sailor who took me to serve on their ship.I needed to escape my community quickly, so I stowed away on a ship. When the crew found me, I was forced to work for my passage.

Bond: I'll always remember my first ship.
Flaw: I follow orders, even if I think they're wrong.

Important Life Events:
Just before I turned 11, I suffered a grievous injury during an adventure. Although the wound healed, it still pains me from time to time.


Carried Trinkets:
a tiger skull
